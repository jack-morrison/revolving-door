# Return Sizes

Let's take another look at the structure we provided to `door_call`:

```c
// from DOOR_CALL(3C) in the illumos manual
typedef struct {
        char            *data_ptr;      /* Argument/result data */
        size_t          data_size;      /* Argument/result data size */
        door_desc_t     *desc_ptr;      /* Argument/result descriptors */
        uint_t          desc_num;       /* Argument/result num descriptors */
        char            *rbuf;          /* Result area */
        size_t          rsize;          /* Result size */
} door_arg_t;
```

What's with all the "Argument/result" stuff? That tells us that the doors
api expects to be able to overwrite some of the data we give it: that is, `args`
is both an *in* and an *out* parameter:

```c
int result = door_call(door, &args);
```

In this case, `result` only tells us whether `door_call` completed without being
interrupted. Because we passed a pointer to `args`, any of its components could
have been modified during the call, so we need to inspect them to really
understand our results.

Recall the output from the previous lesson: When the server responded "Well,
hello yourself" there was some trailing garbage. That's because we allocated 32
characters for a response, but it returned fewer than that.

This is all a bit confusing (or that's how I felt about it, anyhow): `rsize` is
the total *capacity* of `rbuf`, but the number of meaningful characters returned
by the server process will be written to the `data_size` member. So even though
we had 32 bytes allocated, only 23 of them were used, so only 23 of them should
be printed. To get a better look at that, observe the `printf` statement near
the bottom of [client.c](client.c).
